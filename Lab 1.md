# Lab 1:
1. Check if your processor supports Intel/AMD virtualization technology. Enable Intel virtualization technology in BIOS if possible.
Answer:
My pc has AMD virtualization technology. 
While on the laptop I use Intel virtualization technology. 


2. The cloud is almost everywhere in our lives now. What do you think are the fundamental reasons behind its success? Name three pros and three cons of cloud.
Answer:
Fundamental reasons: 
Scalability – Easily scale up/down based on demand. 
Cost Efficiency – Pay-as-you-go pricing eliminates upfront hardware costs. 
Accessibility – Access data/applications from anywhere with an internet connection. 

Pros: 
Cost savings (no need to buy and maintain physical servers). 
Flexibility (access from anywhere). 
Disaster recovery (automatic backups, redundancy). 

Cons: 
Security concerns (data stored on third-party servers). 
Dependency on the internet (downtime issues). 
Limited control (users rely on cloud providers for maintenance). 


3. What is the primary function of a hypervisor in virtualization?
Answer:
A hypervisor manages and allocates hardware resources to multiple virtual machines (VMs), allowing them to run independently on the same physical hardware. 

4. What is a virtual machine (VM)?
Answer:
A virtual machine is a software-based emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications as if it were a real machine. 

5. What are the benefits of using virtual machines?
Answer:
Isolation – Each VM operates independently. 
Portability – VMs can be easily moved across different systems. 
Cost efficiency – Reduces the need for physical hardware. 

6. List five use cases of virtual machines.
Answers: Five use cases of virtual machines: 
Running multiple OS on a single computer. 
Software development and testing. 
Server virtualization for efficient resource use. 
Running legacy applications. 
Cloud computing services. 

7. In virtualization, what is the guest operating system?
a) The main operating system running on the physical machine
b) The operating system installed on a virtual machine
c) The operating system running on a remote server
d) The operating system running on a mobile device
Answer: (b) The operating system installed on a virtual machine. 

8. What does virtual machine isolation mean?
a) Virtual machines can communicate directly with the physical hardware.
b) Virtual machines share the same resources and cannot be isolated.
c) Virtual machines run independently and are isolated from each other and the host system.
d) Virtual machines can only be accessed locally.
Answer: (c) Virtual machines run independently and are isolated from each other and the host system. 

9. What is the benefit of virtual machine portability?
a) It allows virtual machines to communicate with each other easily.
b) It ensures faster boot times for virtual machines.
c) It allows virtual machines to be moved between different physical machines with compatible hypervisors.
d) It reduces the need for hardware virtualization.
Answer: (c) It allows virtual machines to be moved between different physical machines with compatible hypervisors. 

10. What is the purpose of cloning a virtual machine?
Cloning a VM creates an identical copy for backup, testing, deployment, or rapid scaling 
Cloning is also useful when deploying several virtual machines with the same resource allocation and configurations.
