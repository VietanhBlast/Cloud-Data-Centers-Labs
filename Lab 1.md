### 2. The cloud is almost everywhere in our lives now. What do you think are the fundamental reasons behind its success? Name three pros and three cons of cloud.
**Fundamental Reasons:**  
- **Scalability:** Resources can be scaled up or down based on demand.  
- **Cost Efficiency:** Pay-as-you-go pricing eliminates upfront hardware costs.  
- **Accessibility:** Data and applications are accessible from anywhere with an internet connection.

**Pros:**  
- **Cost Savings:** No need to invest in and maintain physical servers.  
- **Flexibility:** Enables remote work and easy access to applications.  
- **Disaster Recovery:** Automatic backups and redundancy enhance data security.

**Cons:**  
- **Security Concerns:** Data stored on third-party servers may be vulnerable to breaches.  
- **Internet Dependency:** Service interruptions or connectivity issues can lead to downtime.  
- **Limited Control:** Users depend on cloud providers for system maintenance and updates.

### 3. What is the primary function of a hypervisor in virtualization?
**Answer:**  
A hypervisor manages and allocates hardware resources to multiple virtual machines (VMs), enabling them to run independently on the same physical hardware.

---

### 4. What is a virtual machine (VM)?
**Answer:**  
A virtual machine is a software-based emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications as if it were a physical machine.

---

### 5. What are the benefits of using virtual machines?
**Answer:**  
- **Isolation:** Each VM operates independently, minimizing the risk of interference between systems.  
- **Portability:** VMs can be easily transferred between different physical systems.  
- **Cost Efficiency:** Reduces the need for physical hardware, lowering overall costs.
- **Testing & Development:** VMs allow developers to test different software configurations without affecting the host system.
- **Resource Efficiency:** VMs optimize hardware usage by running multiple OS instances on a single machine.

### 6. List five use cases of virtual machines.
**Answer:**  
- Running multiple operating systems on a single physical computer.  
- Facilitating software development and testing in isolated environments.  
- Optimizing resource use through server virtualization.  
- Running legacy applications that require specific configurations.  
- Supporting cloud computing services with scalable on-demand resources.

### 7. In virtualization, what is the guest operating system?
a) The main operating system running on the physical machine  
b) The operating system installed on a virtual machine  
c) The operating system running on a remote server  
d) The operating system running on a mobile device  
**Answer:**  
(b) The operating system installed on a virtual machine.

### 8. What does virtual machine isolation mean?
a) Virtual machines can communicate directly with the physical hardware.  
b) Virtual machines share the same resources and cannot be isolated.  
c) Virtual machines run independently and are isolated from each other and the host system.  
d) Virtual machines can only be accessed locally.  
**Answer:**  
(c) Virtual machines run independently and are isolated from each other and the host system.

---

### 9. What is the benefit of virtual machine portability?
a) It allows virtual machines to communicate with each other easily.  
b) It ensures faster boot times for virtual machines.  
c) It allows virtual machines to be moved between different physical machines with compatible hypervisors.  
d) It reduces the need for hardware virtualization.  
**Answer:**  
(c) It allows virtual machines to be moved between different physical machines with compatible hypervisors.

### 10. What is the purpose of cloning a virtual machine?
**Answer:**  
Cloning a virtual machine creates an exact copy of an existing VM. This process is beneficial for:
- **Backup:** Creating a recoverable copy in case of system failure.
- **Testing:** Allowing safe experimentation without affecting the original VM.
- **Deployment:** Rapidly provisioning multiple VMs with identical configurations.
- **Scaling:** Quickly duplicating environments to meet increased demand.
